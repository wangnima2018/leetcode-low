<h3>题意<h3>
<p>Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.<p>

<h3>解题<h3>
<p>用list1存储所有对应word1出现的位置，list2存储所有对应word2出现的位置。如果遍历两个list，找到最短距离<p>

```python
class Solution(object):
    def shortestDistance(self, words, word1, word2):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type word1: str
        :type word2: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        list1 = []
        list2 = []
        for i in xrange(len(words)):
            if words[i] == word1:
                list1.append(i)
            if words[i] == word2:
                list2.append(i)
            
        diff = sys.maxint
        for e1 in list1:
            for e2 in list2:
                if abs(e1-e2) < diff:
                    diff = abs(e1-e2)
                    
        return diff
 ```
